# Apophis\` style for station datasheets

This is [Apophis`](http://apophis.cz/) style for station datasheets.

The style consists of `xsl` and `css` files, which should be used to render
`xml` with station data.

This style is currently being used for styling [TT model railroad stations
at KMZ Brno I](https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/ds-tt).
